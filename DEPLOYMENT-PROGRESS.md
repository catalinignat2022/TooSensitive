# TooSensitive Railway Deployment Progress Summary

## 🎯 Current Status: Railway Rebuilding
**Last Update:** $(date)
**Build Status:** In Progress (fixing missing file)

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Apache ServerName Warning (AH00558)
- **Problem:** Apache couldn't determine server's FQDN
- **Solution:** Added `ServerName r2y974z6.up.railway.app` to apache2.conf
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed in latest build

### 2. Missing Apache Config File
- **Problem:** `apache-railway-minimal.conf` not tracked in git
- **Error:** `"/apache-railway-minimal.conf": not found`
- **Solution:** Added file to git and pushed
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. Health Check Strategy
- **Problem:** WordPress takes too long to load for health checks
- **Solution:** Changed from `/` to `/health-check.php` endpoint
- **Benefit:** Fast response without database dependencies
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Railway Health Check
```json
{
  "healthcheckPath": "/health-check.php",
  "healthcheckTimeout": 100
}
```

### Apache Optimization
- ServerName: r2y974z6.up.railway.app
- Security headers enabled
- Compression (deflate) enabled
- Optimized for Railway environment

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/health-check.php` - Primary (PHP with system info)
- `/health-check.html` - Fallback (static HTML)

## 📊 Expected Results

Railway deployment should now:
1. ✅ Build successfully (no missing files)
2. ✅ Start Apache without ServerName warnings
3. ✅ Pass health checks on `/health-check.php`
4. ✅ Serve WordPress on main domain

## 🌐 Domain Configuration (GoDaddy)

**Required DNS Records:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 66.33.22.48

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: r2y974z6.up.railway.app
```

## 📋 Verification Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Test health endpoint: `curl https://r2y974z6.up.railway.app/health-check.php`
2. Test main site: `curl https://r2y974z6.up.railway.app/`
3. Configure custom domain in Railway dashboard
4. Test custom domain: `curl https://rejectionsensitive.com/`
